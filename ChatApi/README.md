# Chat API

## Overview
The Chat API is a Spring Boot application that integrates with the OpenAI API for chat completions. It allows users to send chat prompts and receive responses generated by the OpenAI model. Below are the key components of the API:

- **Spring Boot Application (ChatApiApplication):**
  - The main entry point for the application.
  - Configures the OpenAI API key using the `openaiApiKey` property.
  - Initializes a `RestTemplate` bean to make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.
  
- **Chat Message (ChatMessage):**
  - Represents a chat message with field:
    - `content`: The actual chat content.
    
- **Chat Completion Response (ChatCompletionResponse):**
  - Represents the response from the OpenAI chat completions API.
  - Contains a list of `Choice` objects, each with an index and a `ChatMessage`.
  
- **Chat Controller (ChatController):**
  - A Spring `@RestController` that handles chat requests.
  - Exposes an endpoint (`/chatRequest`) to receive chat prompts.
  - Sends the prompt to the OpenAI API and extracts the completed message from the response.

## API Endpoints
- **POST /chatRequest**
  - **Description:** Submit a chat prompt to the API.
  - **Request Body:**
    ```json
    {
        "prompt": "What is OpenAI?"
    }
    ```
    
## Usage
1. Start the Spring Boot application.
2. Send a POST request to `/chatRequest` with the chat prompt in the request body.
3. Receive the generated chat response.
